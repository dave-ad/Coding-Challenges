# Coding Challenges

Weekly coding challenge aimed to help me level up my skills through deliberate practice.

These are challenges that I am using as exercises to learn a new programming language or technology.

Each challenge will have me writing a full application or tool. Most of which will be based on real world tools and utilities.

The challenges are picked to be small enough to completed in my spare time over a week or two and yet large enough to be complete working projects.
